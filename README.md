1. Write a program for error detecting code using CRC-CCITT (16-bits)
2. Write a program for Hamming Code generation for error detection and correction3. Write a program for frame sorting techniques used in buffers.
4. Using TCP/IP sockets, write a client-server program to make client sending the file name and the server to send back the contents of the requested file if present
5. Write a program for a distance vector algorithm to find a suitable path for transmission.
6. Write a program for congestion control using Leaky bucket algorithm.
7. Simulate a three nodes point-to-point network with duplex links between them. Set the queue size, vary the bandwidth, and find the number of packets dropped.
8. Simulate a four-node point-to-point network, and connect the links as follows: n0- n2, n1-n2 and n2-n3. Apply TCP agent between n0-n3 and UDP n1-n3. Apply relevant applications over TCP and UDP agents changing the parameter and determine the number of packets by TCP/UDP.
9. Simulate the different types of Internet traffic such as FTP a TELNET over a network and analyze the throughput.
10. Simulate the transmission of ping messaged over a network topology consisting of 6 nodes and find the number of packets dropped due to congestion.
11. Simulate an Ethernet LAN using N nodes and set multiple traffic nodes and determine collision across different nodes.
